# Origin C++11 (from Google Code)

This repository is a rebuild of the original version of the Origin C++11
Libraries, developed during my time as a PhD student at Kent State University
and later as a postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&M University.

I haven't tried to preserve the SVN history. This is simply a snapshot of the
last commits. I may, time permitting, spend some time migrating the commit
history. However, that isn't a priority.

I am not currently maintaining this project, but may return to it as time in
the future.
